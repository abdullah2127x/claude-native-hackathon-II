# Implementation Plan: Voice Input for CLI Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-voice-input-add-todo` | **Date**: 2026-01-07 | **Spec**: D:/AbdullahQureshi/workspace/Hackathon-2025/hackathon-2/todo-in-memory-console-app/specs/001-voice-input-add-todo/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-voice-input-add-todo/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement voice input functionality for the CLI todo application that allows users to add tasks by speaking instead of typing. The feature integrates with the python-voice-to-text-cli agent skill to convert speech to text, includes visual indicators for recording status, and provides seamless fallback to text input when voice recognition fails. The implementation follows TDD principles with comprehensive unit, integration, and contract tests.
